        Chinese art is visual art that originated in or is practiced in China,
        Greater China or by Chinese artists. Art created by Chinese residing
        outside of China can also be considered a part of Chinese art when it is
        based on or draws on Chinese culture, heritage, and history. Early
        "Stone Age art" dates back to 10,000 BC, mostly consisting of simple
        pottery and sculptures. After that period, Chinese art, like Chinese
        history, was typically classified by the succession of ruling dynasties
        of Chinese emperors, most of which lasted several hundred years. The
        Palace Museum in Beijing and the National Palace Museum in Taipei
        contains extensive collections of Chinese art.

        Chinese art is marked by an unusual degree of continuity within, and
        consciousness of, tradition, lacking an equivalent to the Western
        collapse and gradual recovery of Western classical styles of art.
        Decorative arts are extremely important in Chinese art, and much of the
        finest work was produced in large workshops or factories by essentially
        unknown artists, especially in Chinese ceramics.

        Much of the best work in ceramics, textiles, carved lacquer were
        produced over a long period by the various Imperial factories or
        workshops, which as well as being used by the court was distributed
        internally and abroad on a huge scale to demonstrate the wealth and
        power of the Emperors. In contrast, the tradition of ink wash painting,
        practiced mainly by scholar-officials and court painters especially of
        landscapes, flowers, and birds, developed aesthetic values depending on
        the individual imagination of and objective observation by the artist
        that are similar to those of the West, but long pre-dated their
        development there. After contacts with Western art became increasingly
        important from the 19th century onwards, in recent decades China has
        participated with increasing success in worldwide contemporary art.
